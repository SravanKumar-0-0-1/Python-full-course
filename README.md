# Python-full-course
# 1. Introduction to Python
Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its readability and simplicity. It supports multiple paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming. Python is widely used in web development, data science, machine learning, automation, and more.

# 2. Variables and Data Types
Variables: Containers for storing data. Python variables are dynamically typed, meaning they donâ€™t require explicit type declaration.
Data Types:
Numeric: int (integer), float (decimal numbers), complex (complex numbers).
Text: str (string).
Boolean: bool (True/False).
Sequence: list (ordered, mutable), tuple (ordered, immutable), range (sequence of numbers).
Set: set (unordered, unique elements), frozenset (immutable set).
Mapping: dict (key-value pairs).
# 3. Operators in Python
Operators are symbols that perform operations on variables and values.

Arithmetic Operators: Used for mathematical operations (+, -, *, /, etc.).
Comparison Operators: Used for comparing values (==, !=, >, <, etc.).
Logical Operators: Used for boolean logic (and, or, not).
Bitwise Operators: Perform operations on binary numbers (&, |, ^, etc.).
Assignment Operators: Used for assigning values (=, +=, -=, etc.).
Identity Operators: Check if two objects are the same (is, is not).
Membership Operators: Check if a value exists in a sequence (in, not in).
# 4. Control Flow Statements
Conditional Statements (if-elif-else): Used to make decisions based on conditions.
Loops:
for loop: Iterates over a sequence (list, tuple, string, etc.).
while loop: Repeats a block of code as long as a condition is True.
Loop Control Statements:
break: Terminates the loop prematurely.
continue: Skips the current iteration and moves to the next.
pass: Placeholder for future code.
# 5. Functions
Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform a specific task.

Built-in Functions: Predefined functions like print(), len(), type(), etc.
User-defined Functions: Custom functions created using the def keyword.
Function Arguments:
Positional arguments: Passed in order.
Keyword arguments: Passed with parameter names.
Default arguments: Predefined values for parameters.
Variable-length arguments: Allow passing multiple values (*args, **kwargs).
Return Values: Functions can return a value using the return statement.
# 6. Data Structures
Python provides several built-in data structures:

Lists: Ordered, mutable collections that allow duplicate values.
Tuples: Ordered, immutable collections that allow duplicate values.
Sets: Unordered collections with unique elements.
Dictionaries: Unordered key-value pairs used for fast lookups.
# 7. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
Python supports object-oriented programming, which allows organizing code using objects and classes.

Classes and Objects: A class is a blueprint for creating objects, while an object is an instance of a class.
Attributes and Methods: Attributes store data, and methods define behavior.
Encapsulation: Restricts access to certain details of an object to prevent accidental modification.
Inheritance: Allows one class to inherit properties and methods from another.
Polymorphism: Enables different classes to use the same interface.
# 8. Exception Handling
Errors can occur during program execution. Python handles these using exceptions.

Common Exceptions: ZeroDivisionError, IndexError, KeyError, TypeError, etc.
Handling Exceptions (try-except): Prevents program crashes by catching errors.
Finally Block: Executes code regardless of whether an exception occurs.
# 9. Modules and Packages
Modules: Python files containing reusable code. Can be imported using import statement.
Standard Library Modules: Python comes with built-in modules like math, os, random, datetime, etc.
Third-Party Modules: External libraries that can be installed using pip.
Packages: Collections of modules organized in directories.
# 10. File Handling
Python allows reading and writing files using built-in functions.

Modes:
r: Read mode (default).
w: Write mode (overwrites existing content).
a: Append mode (adds content to the file).
r+: Read and write mode.
Reading and Writing Files: Files can be opened, modified, and closed properly using with open() for better handling.
# 11. Regular Expressions (Regex)
Regular expressions (regex) are patterns used to match strings.

Common Patterns: Used for searching, replacing, and validating text.
Regex Methods: findall(), search(), match(), sub(), etc.
Regex Metacharacters: ^ (start of string), $ (end of string), . (any character), * (zero or more occurrences), etc.
# 12. Decorators
Decorators are functions that modify the behavior of other functions. They are commonly used in logging, authentication, and performance tracking.

# 13. Generators
Generators are functions that yield values lazily using the yield keyword. They are memory efficient and useful for large datasets.

# Graphical User Interface (GUI) 
A Graphical User Interface (GUI) is a visual way for users to interact with software using graphical elements like windows, buttons, icons, and text fields instead of text-based commands. GUI applications provide a user-friendly experience by allowing users to interact through clicks, drag-and-drop, and keyboard inputs.

# PyQt5 Toolkit
PyQt5 is a popular Python library used for building GUI applications. It is a set of Python bindings for Qt, a powerful C++ framework for cross-platform application development. PyQt5 allows developers to create desktop applications with modern, responsive interfaces that run on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

Features of PyQt5:
Provides a wide range of widgets (buttons, labels, text fields, etc.).
Supports event handling (responding to user interactions).
Allows custom styling with CSS-like stylesheets.
Comes with Qt Designer, a drag-and-drop tool for designing interfaces.
Supports multithreading for handling background tasks.
Allows the creation of cross-platform applications.
